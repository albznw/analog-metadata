# Readme template

Template to make good looking, structured readmes.

## About the project
In order to make better readmes I created this readme template that includes everything of importance.

Take me to the [template](TEMPLATE.md)

## Getting started

### Installation
Stand in the directory where you want the readme to be. Download the readme template to the directory.
```sh
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albzn540/doc-template/master/TEMPLATE.md > README.md
```

### Usage
1. To minimize work (which this template is all about), search and replace `github_username`, `repo` with your information.

2. Populate the readme with the appropriate content. This is the hard part. 


## Acknowledgements
This template is heavily based upon [BEST-README-template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) by [othneildrew](https://github.com/othneildrew). Cudos to that person!
